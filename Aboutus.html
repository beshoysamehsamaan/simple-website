            <h1> Apple History</h1>
            <p>Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is a multinational corporation that creates consumer electronics, personal computers, servers, and computer software, and is a digital distributor of media content. The company also has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores. Apple's core product lines are the iPhone smart phone, iPad tablet computer, iPod portable media players, and Macintosh computer line. Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple Computer on April 1, 1976, and incorporated the company on January 3, 1977, in Cupertino, California. For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1996 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple. The following year he became the company's interim CEO, which later became permanent. Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998 With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop "Computer" from the company's name in 2007. The company is now also known for its iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of 30 June 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization,[6] with an estimated value of US$695 billion as of February 9, 2017.[7] Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011[8] and $156 billion in 2012.[9]</p>

            <h1> Why Apple isn't compelet !</h1>
            <p class="ab3p">To answer this question, we recall a simple and famous saying made by Apple founder Steve Jobs and made it the charter of his huge company. As Steve Jobs put it, "The beauty of everything is not complete, so is life if it were completed for us because we felt no attraction to it." That this statement was reflected on Apple's global slogan. In an interview with Apple logo designer Rob Janoff, he said that the reason he made the apple incomplete was the desire to distinguish it from cherries. If it were complete, many people would think of it as a crown, but the size of the apple makes it impossible to resemble the crown!</p>

            <h1>Why do They Use I Before Any apple product</h1>
            <p class="ab4p">The story dates back to 1997 when Apple founder Steve Jobs returned to the company after leaving it for a few months because of disagreements with some partners. This year, Jobs decided to enliven a popular Apple product at the time, (Mac).
With the additions proposed and implemented by Jobs with Apple's development team, a new generation of Macs has emerged, supporting for the first time the USB media, as well as a new form of design.
The main advantages of this device and the speed of access to the Internet (in ten minutes only), which was a record time at the time !!!
Hence, the idea of ??choosing the first letter of the English word in English is the letter (i) to be added to the previous name of the device (Mac), for the first time to show the name of the Mac, and then decide to continue the character in the following products: iPhone, iPad, IPod Touch.
We all wait for Apple to introduce a new IE watch, Smart Clock, at the end of this year.</p>
